# Assembly_2018
This repository contains x86 NASM assembly language programs that I have written. My most notable assembly language program is 512. This is a very small snake-like game that fits within the first 512 bytes of a boot sector. Essentially it is its own operating system and it must be loaded as a bootable medium in order to play.
